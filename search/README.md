# Search

## Time Complexity

### 1. Linear Search
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The target element is the first element in the array.
- **Average Case**: *O(n)* - The target element is found in the middle of the array.
- **Worst Case**: *O(n)* - The target element is not present in the array or is the last element.

### 2. Binary Search
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The target element is the middle element of the array.
- **Average Case**: *O(log n)* - The target element is found after several divisions of the array.
- **Worst Case**: *O(log n)* - The target element is not present, requiring the entire array to be searched through divisions.
