# Stack

## Time Complexity

### 1. Push
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not full, and the element is added to the top.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not full, and the operation is performed in constant time.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not full, and the operation is performed in constant time.

### 2. Pop
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not empty, and the top element is removed.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.

### 3. Peek
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not empty, and the top element is accessed.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.

### 4. IsEmpty
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The stack is empty.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The operation checks the status of the stack.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The operation checks the status of the stack.
