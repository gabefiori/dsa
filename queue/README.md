# Queue (Using Linked List)

## Time Complexity

### 1. Enqueue
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The new element is added to the rear of the queue.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The new element is added to the rear of the queue.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The new element is added to the rear of the queue.

### 2. Dequeue
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is not empty, and the front element is removed.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.

### 3. Peek
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is not empty, and the front element is accessed.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is not empty, and the operation is performed in constant time.

### 4. IsEmpty
- **Best Case**: *O(1)* - The queue is empty.
- **Average Case**: *O(1)* - The operation checks the status of the queue.
- **Worst Case**: *O(1)* - The operation checks the status of the queue.
