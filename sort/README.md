# Sort

## Time Complexity

### 1. Insertion Sort
- **Best Case**: *O(n)* - The array is already sorted.
- **Average Case**: *O(n^2)* - The elements are in random order.
- **Worst Case**: *O(n^2)* - The array is sorted in reverse order.

### 2. Quick Sort
- **Best Case**: *O(n log n)* - The pivot divides the array into two equal halves.
- **Average Case**: *O(n log n)* - The pivot is chosen randomly.
- **Worst Case**: *O(n^2)* - The pivot is the smallest or largest element, leading to unbalanced partitions.

### 3. Bubble Sort
- **Best Case**: *O(n)* - The array is already sorted (optimized version).
- **Average Case**: *O(n^2)* - The elements are in random order.
- **Worst Case**: *O(n^2)* - The array is sorted in reverse order.
